## human written readme.md
## entire website is vibecoded except system architecture
## techstack : php, html, js, mysql, css

This was built by venkat badhri during his internship period in icf. if any error or bugs in the website and cant resolve it contact me 7305911049. 

each page is built using the php file and in that the language i used are html php javascript and sql

so for only pages without crud functionalities there is only one php file related to them
                *dashboard.php

pages with server requirement i made it using 2 files. one for the frontend and one for the backend and there are some exceptions where i might have used 3 files like adding assets

it might be mentioned three users but in reality it only has 2 users one is admin and another one is staff. i thought there was no requirement for the manager user so i didnt add it

i vibe coded entire thing. but the system architecture was build by humans not entirely by me but my higher officer. i made some tweaks and some changes in the system architecture. other than that the entire website is vibecoded

i used chat gpt for the vibe ocding part. no other ai is being used. as you guessed from the gradient background colour every page is created by chat gpt (GO version prolly version 5.2)

and the php version i used is PHP Version 5.6.32 so other version code wont be compatible

for the database i used the mysql so the date field are easy to declare

if you like my work and want to do more websites and applications both in react and python i can do. you know what to do conact me
